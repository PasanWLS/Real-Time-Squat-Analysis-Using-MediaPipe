Real-Time Squat Analysis with MediaPipe, OpenCV 🏋️‍♂️🚀

I’m excited to share my latest project where I combine MediaPipe and OpenCV for real-time squat analysis, and then save the data for deeper insights with a Power BI dashboard! 🏋️‍♂️
This tool tracks your squat performance, evaluates posture, and stores detailed data for further analysis. 📊 The data is saved in a file format that can be imported into Power BI for creating visual analytics and progress reports. Now, you can not only track your form but also monitor improvement over time! 🚀

🔑 Key Features:
• Real-time squat form analysis using MediaPipe & OpenCV
• Posture evaluation to optimize workouts and prevent injuries
• Squat data is stored and saved for ongoing performance tracking
• Visual analysis and insights with Power BI dashboard integration 📊
• Customizable metrics for detailed progress reports

💥 Optimize your fitness performance and visualize your growth with real-time feedback and actionable insights!
